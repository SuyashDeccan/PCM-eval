The factory quality control randomly selects a sample of 50 units for inspection each day.

In each round, the gambler wins $1$ dollar with probability $p$ and loses $1$ dollar with probability $q = 1 - p$, where $0 < p < 1$.

The gambler plays the game once, and the outcome is observed: - Let $Y = 1$ if the gambler reaches the target $N$ dollars. - Let $Y = 0$ if the gambler goes bankrupt $0$ dollars.
