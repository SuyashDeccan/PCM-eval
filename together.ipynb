      "Alright, so let's compute the percentiles for the Gamma distribution.\n",

      "\n",
      "But in our case, the Gamma distribution is Gamma(12, 2300.01). So, the shape parameter is 12, and the rate is 2300.01. To relate this to a chi-squared distribution, we can write:\n",

The conjugate of z, denoted as z̄, is a - bi. The modulus of z, |z|, is the distance from the origin to the point (a, b) in the complex plane, which is sqrt(a² + b²). So, |z| is a non-negative real number.\n",

To find 1/z², I can write it as 1/(z²) = 1/[(a² - b²) + 2abi]. To simplify this, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (a² - b²) - 2abi. So,\n",

      "Suppose Mr. Fat picks three numbers: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Mr. Taf can choose any two of them to be \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). So, he can choose \\(b = a\\) and \\(c = b\\), but that would make the discriminant \\(a^2 - 4a\\), or \\(b^2 - 4c = a^2 - 4a\\), or \\(c^2 - 4b = a^2 - 4a\\). Alternatively, he can choose \\(b = a\\) and \\(c = c\\), so discriminant \\(a^2 - 4c\\), or \\(b^2 - 4c = a^2 - 4c\\), or \\(c^2 - 4b = c^2 - 4a\\). Similarly, if he chooses \\(b = c\\) and \\(c = a\\), discriminant \\(c^2 - 4a\\), or \\(b^2 - 4c = c^2 - 4c\\), or \\(c^2 - 4b = c^2 - 4c\\).\n",

      "So, depending on which two numbers are assigned to \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), the discriminant is one of these three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Mr. Taf can choose the discriminant to be any of these three expressions. So, he can pick the discriminant as \\(a^2 - 4b\\), \\(a^2 - 4c\\), or \\(b^2 - 4c\\). So, he can choose which one he wants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Mr. Taf's goal is to choose one of these three expressions to be a perfect square. So, he can try to set one of them to a perfect square, regardless of the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n",

So, Mr. Taf can't make it have two distinct real solutions, so Mr. Fat wins.\n",

      "But wait, is that the only case? What if Mr. Fat picks numbers such that all three discriminants are negative? For example, if all three numbers are negative, then \\(b^2\\) is positive, but \\(4c\\) is negative, so \\(b^2 - 4c\\) is positive plus positive, which is positive. So, discriminant is positive, so two distinct real solutions.\n",
