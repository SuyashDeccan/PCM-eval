18305,"On the synchronization manifold x₁ = x₂ = x, define z₁ := x − y₁ and z₂ := x − y₂. Then the reduced (invariant) system in ℝ³ is:

ẋ = 1,  
ż₁ = z₁ − ν₁ (cos x − sin x),  
ż₂ = z₂ + ν₂ (sin x − cos x),

with mismatch parameter ν = ν₂ − ν₁ if needed."

18532,"1) By considering  
   J(a) = ∫₀^∞ [ x^a e^(i x) / (1 + x² ) ] dx  
   and analyzing it via a contour in the upper half‐plane, one finds that the sole contribution comes from the simple pole at z = i. Matching that to the integral on the real axis (and accounting carefully for the branch cut of z^a) leads, after taking imaginary parts, to I(a).

2) As a → +∞, the integral is dominated by large x. One obtains the leading asymptotic form  
   I(a) ∼ −cos((πa)/2) × [Γ(a)/a],  
   and, more explicitly, using Stirling’s approximation,  
   I(a) ∼ −√(2π) a^(a − 3/2) e^(−a) cos((πa)/2)."

18479,"The possible values of |z| are precisely those positive real numbers r for which r² + 1/r² = √(M² + N²) with M, N integers and M² + N² ≥ 4. Equivalently, let k = M² + N² be any integer ≥ 4 that is the sum of two squares. Then, setting a = √k ≥ 2, the corresponding r must satisfy:  
r² + 1/r² = a,  
which yields r = √((a ± √(a² - 4)) / 2).  
In particular, there are infinitely many possible values of |z|, one (or two) for each integer k ≥ 4 that is a sum of two squares."
