The factory quality control randomly selects a sample of 50 units for inspection each day. However, due to the random nature of the defect process, there is an additional factor: if the first unit inspected is defective, the probability that the next unit inspected is also defective increases to 0.07. Conversely, if the first unit is non-defective, the probability for the second unit decreases to 0.03.

In each round, the gambler wins $1$ dollar with probability $p$ and loses $1$ dollar with probability $q = 1 - p$, where $0 < p < 1$. The classical probability of reaching the target for $p\\neq q$ is given by: $$ P(i) = \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^i}{1 - \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N}. $$ Now, suppose that the true winning probability \\( p \\) is unknown and is modeled by a Beta prior distribution: $$ p \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta), $$ with known hyperparameters $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$. The gambler plays the game once, and the outcome is observed: - Let $Y = 1$ if the gambler reaches the target $N$ dollars. - Let $Y = 0$ if the gambler goes bankrupt $0$ dollars.
